	<p>Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band
		consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar,
		keyboards) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are fictional and are not personas of any
		"real life" musicians involved in the project.[8] Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music
		videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the only permanent musical
		contributor, and the music is often a collaboration between various musicians. Writers and critics have
		described their music as alternative rock.</p> <br>
