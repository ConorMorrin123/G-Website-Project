            Tyron Kaymone Frampton (born 18 December 1994), better known by his stage name Slowthai (stylised in <br>
            lowercase), is a British rapper. Raised in Northampton, he rose to popularity in 2019 for his gritty and
            <br>
            rough instrumentals and raw, politically charged lyrics, especially around Brexit and Theresa May’s tenure
            <br>
            as British Prime Minister. Slowthai placed 4th in the BBC Sound Of 2019 and followed up in the same year
            <br>
            with his debut studio album, Nothing Great About Britain. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize; at
            <br>
            Slowthai’s 2019 Mercury Prize ceremony performance, he held a fake severed head of British Prime Minister
            <br>
            Boris Johnson on stage, generating much controversy. <br>
